# New information, here is the game
    3-dice-casino

    (This is not its actual name, but I can’t find it again)

    This is a rather old game. I’ve read it in a book co-written by
    Martin Gardner.

    The players (can be any number) bet 1 dollar per round on any number
    from 1 to 6(It doesn’t have to be dollars)

    Now the game master rolls 3 normal dice. If the number of the player
    shows up once, the player gets back his dollar plus another dollar. If
    the number of the player shows up twice, the player gets back his
    dollar plus two more. And if the number of the player shows up on
    all three dice, the player gets back his dollarplus three more. If
    the number does not show up, the game master gets the dollar.



    Explanation:

    Most people think this game is completely fair or even in favour for
    the players themselves, because they believe there are 6 possibilities
    and 3
     dice are rolled, so in 1 of 2 cases the player should win an
     additional dollar. Plus there’s the possibility of winning extra
     if the number
    shows up more than once.

    But this is wrong!

    Because the dice can show the same number, the possibility that the
    number of the player shows up is actually 91 in 216 and not 1 in
    2. I don’t want to get too mathematical, but in the long run this
    means that the game master gets around 7 percent of every dollar
    that is bet.
